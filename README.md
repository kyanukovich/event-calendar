<h1>Event Calendar</h1>

<p>This is a primitive Event Calendar app constructed with Vue.js. First I tried to look for templates, none of which seemed to fit the midterm requirements. Eventually, I've found a tutorial video on YouTube on how to create an event calendar using Vue, Vuetify and Firebase, so I tried to do exactly that with minor changes to the script and design, to make sure that the assignment is not copied, but eventually I've abandoned it in fear of being accused of "stealing". I've also applied some Bootstrap styling to make it look pretty.
</p>

<p>This task served as a good introduction to Firebase and Vue applications. Unlike the midterm, which I've felt was a bit gap from what was learned up to that point, I felt more confident getting to this assignment, after spending more time on understanding the exploitation of Vue commands, management of Vue applications, and understanding Vue and Firebase in general.
